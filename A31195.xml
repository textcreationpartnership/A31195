         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Priſoner at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> ſtands Indicted of High Treaſon, and it is for Conſpiring the Murder of the King, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an alteration in the Government in Church and State. And the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment ſets forth, that the 30th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the 30th Year of the King, he and other falſe Traitors did agree to ſtir up Sedition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the Kingdom, and to cauſe a great ſlaughter of his Majeſties Subjects; To introduce the Superſtition of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and Murther the King, and to alter the Government in Church and State. And 'tis there ſaid, that to accompliſh theſe Evil Deſigns, he writ Two Letters to be ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and St. <hi>Omers,</hi> the effect of which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was to procure the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, to alter the Religion Eſtabliſhed by Law in this Kingdom, to <hi>Romiſh</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, to Subvert the Government, and to put the King to Death; and that in further proſecution of theſe Traiterous Deſigns, he writ Two other Letters to be ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to one <hi>Chriſtopher Anderton,</hi> Rector of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colledg, and a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and Two others to be ſent to St. <hi>Omers;</hi> and in theſe Letters he took upon him to Adviſe the way and means by which theſe Treaſons might be effected, and that theſe ſeveral Letters were ſent and delivered by him, and received. The Indictment further ſets forth that in further proſecution of theſe Traiterous Imaginations of his, he did recieve 5 ſeveral Commiſſions in Writing, by Authority derived from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and thoſe were for the making of Military Officers, to Execute theſe Treaſons by force of Arms, and that he did likewiſe receive 5 other Commiſſions for conſtituting Civil Officers in this Realm, after the Treaſon was committed. And that amongſt the reſt he did receive for himſelf one Commiſſion to be Advocate General of the Army that was to be rais'd. And the Indictment further Charges upon the Priſoner, that to accompliſh theſe Treaſons, whereas <hi>Ireland, Pickering,</hi> and <hi>Grove,</hi> and other falſe Traitors, had conſulted theſe Treaſons, which I before mentioned, Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> had Notice of the Treaſons, and did Conſent to them and Abet them, and that he did ſolicit the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks to advance 6000 <hi>l.</hi> for the Murther of the King, for the Alteration of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and for the Subverſion of the Government in Church and State. And further, whereas Mr <hi>Coleman,</hi> (who was Executed for Treaſon) had (with others) conſpired the Death of the King, and the introducing of Popery, and has writ a Letter to the <hi>French</hi> Confeſſor <hi>Lee Cheeſe,</hi> for Aid and Aſſiſtance, that the Priſoner at the Bar had Notice of this, and that he did conſent to it, and did Abet it. This, Gentlemen, is Charged to be Traiterouſly, and Deviliſhly done againſt the Priſoners Allegiance, and the form of the Statute. To this he hath pleaded Not Guilty, but if we prove theſe Treaſons, or any of them, you are to find him Guilty.</p>

                  <p>This Treaſon was no leſs than to murther the King, to alter the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to overturn the Law, to raiſe an Army, by force to effect all this, and in ſhort to do all the miſchief that men (if it be lawful to call ſuch Creatures men) could do. That there was in order to this, Conſultations held the 24th. of <hi>April</hi> among the Jeſuits; and there it was reſolved that the King ſhould be killed, there were Perſons appointed to do it, that was <hi>Pickering,</hi> and <hi>Grove,</hi> but they failed therein, and they proſecuted it at <hi>Windſor,</hi> but happening to fail there alſo, they followed him to <hi>New-Market,</hi> and Ordered that it ſhould be done there: And when all this failed, they took another courſe, his Majeſty was to be Poiſoned, and as I ſaid before, to make all this good, an Army was to be raiſed of 50000 men in <hi>England,</hi> to perect this Work; but if that would not do, they were to have Forces from beyond Sea to joyn with them: And Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> he writ Letters to procure theſe Forces, and he not only did ſo, but he found the effect of his Letters, and received Commiſſions from beyond Sea, whereof one was for himſelf, to be Advocate General of the Army.

                  <p>I do remember a Letter that came to Mr. <hi>Ewers</hi> from Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> which did expreſs, and begin thus, (<hi>This very night, Sir</hi> Edmond-bury Godfrey <hi>is diſpatched</hi>) with ſome other words of like import; and then I ſent to Mr. <hi>Ewers</hi> about it: And do you think this will carry on the Deſign? I will be hang'd if it don't ſpoil it: No ſaid he, he was a Perſon that uſed to be very ſevere againſt debauch'd lewd Perſons, and ſo it will be laid, as if they had done it out of Revenge.</p>

                  <p>Then I begin thus. In the month of <hi>April</hi> 1677, I went into the Kingdom of <hi>Spain:</hi> in the month of <hi>September</hi> following, the ſons of <hi>Mr. Langhorn</hi> came into the Kingdom of <hi>Spain;</hi> it was <hi>September</hi> or ſooner, but I will not be poſſitive as to the time of their coming, the one was a Scholar of the Engliſh Colledge at <hi>Madrid,</hi> the other was a Scholar of the Engliſh Colledge at <hi>Valledolid.</hi> They came there to ſtudy Philoſophy in order to their receiving of the Prieſthood. my Lord, my occaſions called me into <hi>England</hi> in the month of <hi>November</hi> following, and coming into <hi>England, Mr. Langhorns</hi> ſons did give me ſome Letters to <hi>Mr. Langhorn</hi> their Father; and aſ ſoon as I had reſted my ſelf for a day or two after my Journey, I came to <hi>Mr. Langhorns</hi>'s houſe in <hi>Sheer-Lane.</hi> Now <hi>Mr. Langhorns</hi> Wife being a Zealous Proteſtant, I did whiſper his Footboy or his ſervant boy in the Ear, that he ſhould go and whiſper his Maſter, <hi>Mr. Langhorn,</hi> and tell him, there was one would ſpeak with him from his ſons. <hi>Mr. Langhorn,</hi> by his ſon, did deſire me to meet him at his Chamber in the <hi>Temple,</hi> (in the <hi>Inner-Temple-Lane</hi> it was I think) I know the Chamber however, and accordingly I did meet <hi>Mr. Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> that night by the means of his half Brother, who is brother I think by the mother and not by the Father, his name is <hi>Smithſon;</hi> and when I came into <hi>Mr. Langhorns</hi> Chamber, their Chambers being directly oppoſite one to another, I was treated by <hi>Mr. Langhorn</hi> with a great deal of Civility, and I delivered <hi>Mr. Langhorn</hi> the Letters from his ſons, and I told him that I thought his ſons would enter into the Society: <hi>Mr. Langhorn</hi> was mightily pleaſed with the News, being himſelf a great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary for the Society, that his ſons would enter into it. Now may it pleaſe your Lordſhip, <hi>Mr. Langhorn</hi> did ſay, he thought if they did continue in the world, that is ſecular Prieſts, they would ſuddenly have very great promotion in <hi>England,</hi> for he ſaid, Things would not laſt long in this poſture, that is at that time he then ſpoke, I ſpeak the words now that he ſaid then. And now my Lord, I was with <hi>Mr. Langhorn</hi> another time while I was in <hi>England,</hi> but in the latter end of <hi>November</hi> old Stile, in the beginning of <hi>December</hi> new Stile, I went to <hi>St. Omers,</hi> and there were Letters that he delivered me (looking upon the Priſoner) a Pacquet to carry to <hi>St: Omers.</hi> And when the Pacquet was opened, there was a letter Signed <hi>Richard Langhorn,</hi> in which he gave the Fathers at <hi>St. Omers</hi> great thanks for the great care had of, and kindneſs they ſhew'd to his ſons, and that what they had been out of Pocket for their <hi>Viaticum,</hi> in Order to their journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> which was 20 <hi>l.</hi> he promiſed them they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid it, and in this Letter he did expreſly ſay, that he had written to Father <hi>Le Cheeſe</hi> in order to our concerns, thoſe were his words. Now my Lord the Letter that he writ to Father <hi>Le Cheeſe</hi> I ſaw not, but only this Letter I ſaw, which gave an account of that Letter he had writ to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Le Cheeſe</hi> and he ſaid <hi>Mr. Coleman</hi> had been very large with him, and therefore it would not be neceſſary for him to trouble his Reverence with any large Epiſtles at that time. My Lord, there was another Letter, and I think that was in the month of <hi>March,</hi> or <hi>April</hi> I cannot be poſitive as to the particular time, but it was upon this remarkable Circumſtance. <hi>Mr. Langhorn</hi> had a ſon that had been in Rebellion, and had turned
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97113:7"/>Souldier, or ſome ſuch thing in <hi>France,</hi> and this young Gentleman came to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> being the place where he had been educated; and Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> by the interceſſion of the Fathers there, did order him Five pounds to bring him over into <hi>England,</hi> upon promiſe of his ſons ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, who had been very extravagant in ſeveral reſpects. In this Letter my Lord, Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> did expreſs his great care for the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of the Deſign of the Catholicks, and ſeveral other expreſſions there were in it bad enough, which I cannot now call to mind, but they were to this effect; The Parliament began to Flag in promoting the Proteſtant Religion, and now they had a fair opportunity to begin and give the Blow; what that Blow was, I leave to the Court and to the Jury to expound.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, as to the words of them, I dare not charge my memory, but it was to this purpoſe, That <hi>Le Cheeſe</hi> would ſtand by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Society, and aſſiſt them, and that they ſhould not need to doubt the <hi>French</hi> King, or to that effect.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Look you Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> we had all this matter ſpoken of yeſterday, and there were Witneſſes that prove that Sir <hi>Jeremy Warner,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Preſton,</hi> were there.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
                  <p>I humbly conceive, that was upon an Iſſue tried in another County, by another Jury, and therefore I hope I do not amiſs in urging what I can ſay for my ſelf to this Jury.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>You are not debarred, I only told you of it. Was Sir <hi>Robert Bret</hi> there?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I think he was, I am not confident of that. My Lord, I own what Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> can bring to the Court upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
                  <p>I only ask it, becauſe he ſays ſo in the Houſe of Lords.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>If you can ſhew the Record of what I ſaid there, do.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not deſire him to name them now, but to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he does now affirm the truth of what he Swore in the Houſe of Lords?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>If you can produce, as you may, if you have been diligent, a Copy of the Record in the Houſe of Lord, and have it Sworn to be a true Copy of the Records, it will be Evidence for you, and ſhall be read; but to put him to remember a Record without Book, muſt not be, it would be hard for him to undertake that.</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Indeed the Queſtion is ſo ſudden, that I cannot be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, but as near as I remember, I came by Coach.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
                  <p>I will give you my reaſon why I ask this; becauſe he hath formerly upon a Trial in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> affirmed he came by Coach, in the company of Mr. <hi>Hilsley.</hi>

                  <p>No, I did never ſay ſo; but I came over in the Pacquet Boat, in the company of Mr. <hi>Hilsley,</hi> but when we were come over, Mr. <hi>Hilsley</hi> went out of the way from us.</p>

                  <p>Yes, I was ſometime Vicar of <hi>Bobbing</hi>— in <hi>Kent.</hi> But I ſuppoſe this is to make me accuſe my ſelf of ſomething, whereby I might forfeit my Living: for my Lord, I have a right in a point of Equity ſtill to that Living, but only for going beyond Sea without leave of my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, I am not now Vicar of—</p>

                  <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
                  <p>You became a Papiſt in 1677. I ask this Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did leave his Living before he turned Papiſt?</p>

                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi>

                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>When did you leave your Living? did you leave it before you went away?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>It was not very long before, but the reaſon why I am not willing to tell; When I left the Pariſh, I left it in the charge of Mr. <hi>Thomas Turner,</hi> Vicar of <hi>Milton,</hi> and I did go near about <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and ſerved a Sequeſtration there. The Air was not a good Air in that part of <hi>Kent,</hi> and I had not my health, and that was one reaſon, and for other reaſons beſt known to my ſelf.</p>

                  <p>After he became a Papiſt, I deſire to know, whether he became a Jeſuit? Were you in any Order there?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> it is not a proper Queſtion, we ought not to ask it him: You are a man of the Law, and therefore you know it is not fair to ask any Perſon a Queſtion about a Criminal matter that may bring himſelf in danger.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
                  <p>I take him to be out of danger, he hath his Pardon.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't know what his Pardon is, nor how far it reaches, nor whether this be contained in it; but if Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> pleaſes to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that Queſtion, he may.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
                  <p>Ile give you another reaſon why I ask it, becauſe in one of his Narratives he ſeems to call himſelf ſo; he ſays, <hi>There came over</hi> 9 <hi>of us, all Jeſuits,</hi> I ſuppoſe him to be one of that Order; this I took to be a ground, why I might properly call him ſo.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Narratives are no Evidence at all.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I cannot anſwer it, becauſe it tends rather to raiſe a debate in the Court, than conduces to the Queſtion, to acquit or condemn the Priſoner.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>It is an Inſtrument Signed and Sealed, juſt as the things were, which Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, he ſaw in your Chamber.</p>

Now though it be a thing of a private Concern, a Church matter, not relating to the matters in Queſtion, yet this very Commiſſion is ſo ſubſcribed, and ſo ſigned and ſealed, as Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had deſcribed thoſe to be before in your Chamber.</p>

                  <p>Yes, my Lord, I and <hi>Coleman</hi> walked in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whilſt he went in and writ, as he did other things; for he Regiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all their Accompts: There was not a peny of Money either received or laid out, nor any thing done almoſt in relation to this Concern, but he did keep a Regiſter of it: I cannot ſay, that ever he did talk any thing before me of the Kings death particularly, but talked of the whole Deſign. About a Year and a half ſince, Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> ſent another Pacquet of Letters by me to Mr. <hi>Laghorn</hi> to be Regiſtred; he looked ſtrangely upon me, and received the Letter, and ſent an Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> (for I went then under the name of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Williams</hi>) had delivered him ſuch Letters, and that he ſhould have them again to morrow, after he had Copied them, and Regiſtred them. Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> read the Letter of Anſwer to me, and in the Letter it was Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi> Said I to Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> I thought I might have been Regiſtred by my right name, becauſe when any thing ſhould take effect and occaſion ſerve, I reſolved to bear my own name. Alas, ſays he, this does not ſignifie any thing at all, for as for this Regiſter, it is not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable: there ſhall be a new Regiſter made, of things of weight and moment, this is only a blind Regiſter amongſt our ſelves. The 2 Letters that I brought from <hi>Harcourt,</hi> there was one of them from Sir <hi>William Godolphin,</hi> that I had brought before from <hi>Spain.</hi>

The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Letter from <hi>Stapleton,</hi> which he tranſcribed, was to this effect; That <hi>Coleman</hi> and <hi>Harcourt,</hi> naming themſelves We, (that is, We and the Jeſuites, and it was to the Rector, of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monks in particular, but I miſſed of the Rector and <hi>Mr. Stapleton</hi> receiv'd it) I ſay the effect of that Letter was, they would have a certain anſwer from them—</p>

                  <p>The effect was, that they would have a final Anſwer from thoſe Religious at <hi>Doway,</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> to know how far they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Religious, and all their Friends beyond Sea, in making Collections, and remitting of money, for there was only money wanting; for the Arms of the Catholicks were all ready, and they had all a good mind to the Buſineſs, their Arms and Hearts were ready, and the eaſineſs of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the ſtrength of the power of <hi>France,</hi> made it an opportunity not to be neglected: That the Garriſons were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be put into ſuch hands as they could truſt.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Bedloe.</speaker>
                  <p>There were Three, my Lord; one was to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monks at <hi>Paris,</hi> another was to Monſieur <hi>Le Cheeſe,</hi> another to the Pope's Nuntio.</p>

                  <p>Did thoſe Letters expreſs what the money was to be raiſed for, or did they leave it to be underſtood; my meaning, my Lord, of my Queſtion is this, whether Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> writ to him to haſten the money, and ſaid it was for ſuch a particular uſe, or only in general.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97113:14"/>only we want nothing elſe from beyond Sea, but your aſſiſtance; tho it was not expreſſed in the letter to deſtroy the King and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, yet the full of the diſcourſe betwixt Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> was to this effect.

                  <p>But to my apprehenſion what you ſaid laſt is moſt material, that is the diſcourſe between him and Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> for that Rivets the whole. When he ſaid, that is we had but a Return of this money, then we have made our ſelves ſafe, or words to that effect; but it was to the full meaning of this, that the Proteſtant Religion could not ſtand any longer here, having aſſiſtance from <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p>My Lord, I omitted one thing that was very material in my Evidence, which comes in my mind ſince. The Congregation at <hi>Rome</hi> did contribute 800000 Crowns to be ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> did inquire concerning that money, and had knowledge of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of it in <hi>France,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> did ſay in the month of <hi>July</hi> or <hi>Auguſt.</hi>

He told me it was a Chiding Letter from the Secretary <hi>de propaganda fide,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Barbarino</hi> who had ſent a chiding Letter to Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> and the reſt of the Conſpirators, for going on no faſter when they had ſo fair an opportunity.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>September</hi> laſt, within a Week after the Duke came from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and we were drinking together, for I had not ſeen him for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years before, and there was one <hi>Anthony</hi> was in the company, and ſaid he, I am newly come from <hi>Italy,</hi> and I am going again, and I am come to take my leave of my Friends.

                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>We do tell you, that if we had not judged them to be Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we would not have heard them.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorne.</speaker>
                  <p>They come under the ſame reaſon of Law with an Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, having had their Pardon; I don't ſay they are directly Approvers, but I conceive they come under the ſame reaſon of Law with them, and then if the Approver be pardoned, by the Law the Appellee ought to be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and methinks by the ſame reaſon, theſe men having been <hi>participes Criminis,</hi> and having got their Pardons, ought not to be ſuch ſubſtantial Witneſſes againſt the Priſoner at the Bar. But, my Lord, I have one thing yet further to ask, I deſire to know whether they have not received any Rewards, or Gratifications, for the Diſcovery they have made, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they have done? And whether they do not expect further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> does ſuppoſe that the Witneſſes are corrupted and bribed; Do you think M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <p>If you can ſuppoſe there was any Subornation or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, call your Witneſſes, and prove it; but for their receiving ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and maintenance from the King, that is but reaſonable, and can be no Objection. And you your ſelf know, that an Approver, while he is in that ſervice, hath a Peny a day, which in ancient Times was a great matter for livelihood and ſuſtenance; ſo that any Reward that they have, if you can prove it by Contract or Subornation, you cannot make an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                  <p>That 500 <hi>l.</hi> was about a particular Fact.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

               <sp>

                  <p>His Name is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <p>He is an infamous perſon, he hath ſtood in the Pillory, we can't take him for a Witneſs; but now I'll tell you for the 500 <hi>l.</hi> 'tis a thing we all know of. It was a Reward for a particular buſineſs, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Plot, but it was for the diſcovery of the Murtherers of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey.</hi>

                  <speaker>Mr. J. Atkins.</speaker>
                  <p>I think M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Prance</hi> is here, that will give an account of that, for <hi>Bedloe</hi> diſcovered him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Bedloe.</speaker>
                  <p>I am ſo far from having any benefit by this diſcovery, that I am 700 <hi>l.</hi> out of Pocket.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Ellys.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſhall have the liberty to make what good defence you can for your ſelf, and prove what you can, you muſt not go this way to work.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis pretty reaſonable for us to give a publick ſatisfaction to all the World, that we do nothing under-hand, but that we do in this Caſe as in all other Caſes; any thing that is fit to be anſwered, they ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and perchance in this Caſe ſomething more than can be ſtrictly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us. 'Tis notorious enough, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Oates</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Dedloe</hi> have been fed at the King's charge, and it cannot be objected againſt them, and need not be wink'd at, for they were Parties in the Plot. And when they come to make the Diſcovery, without which we ſhould never have known the Plot, for you know 'tis hard to diſcover any Crime, Forgery, or the like, but by one that hath been privy to it, and a guilty perſon; yet theſe men always have been, and are in Law Witneſſes, and 'tis juſt they ſhould have a Competency to maintain them, ſince they came for the Publick Good to make ſuch Diſcoveries.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. North.</speaker>
                  <p>And that particular Sum of Mony was paid to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe,</hi> in purſuance of the King's Proclamation, which we all know, which was all publickly done.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorne.</speaker>
                  <p>The Reaſon why I preſs this was, becauſe of the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was to invite Perſons to come, touching the diſcovery of this Plot; and to encourage them to it by a promiſe or reward. I think it may be reaſonable enough, where any perſon that is charged with a Crime doth abſent, to propoſe a Reward for the bringing him in. But I think it is hard, that when a Priſoner is in Cuſtody, Witneſſes ſhould be brought in againſt him by ſuch means.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J. North.</speaker>
                  <p>You do Artificially go off from the Point, Anſwer the Evidence that hath been given againſt you, and you ſhall be heard; but you labor very much, and trouble your ſelf to make Anſwer to another matter that is not pertinent.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Does your Defence conſiſt wholly of this ſort of matter, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the incompetency of the Witneſſes? Can you make no Anſwer to the Fact?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorne.</speaker>
                  <p>I muſt tell your Lordſhip, My whole Defence muſt run to diſable the Witneſſes, for my Lord I was committed to <hi>Newgate</hi> the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> and I have been kept there a cloſe Priſoner till this day was ſeven-night, or Friday the laſt Week, I never converſed with any Friend, or any Relation, nor knew any thing of News, but only with ſome few
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97113:16"/>perſons ſent by Authority of the Houſe of Commons or the Council. And I was never examined by any ſince I was committed. I never heard what was charged againſt me, and I could not foreſee what theſe men could teſtifie, becauſe I was not confident whereupon they would proceed; therefore I can have no Defence, unleſs it be by leſſening their Credit, 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I ſhould.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Do, leſſen it if you can. If you have any Witneſſes to take off their Credit, or contradict them, call them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Atkins.</speaker>
                  <p>But I would ſay one thing to you Mr. <hi>Langhorne;</hi> you ſeem to put a very ill Conſtruction upon the Kings Proclamation, as if it were to invite and encourage perſons to come and ſwear about a Plot, where there was none; it was to invite people to make a further Diſcovery of a Plot that lay Cloſe, and we could not fully Diſcover for the preſervation of the King and Kingdom without ſuch a means.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorne.</speaker>
                  <p>He did propoſe a Reward.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Justice Atkins.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Pemberton.</speaker>
                  <p>And ſo you would be cloſe in all your Accounts, and none ſhould be rewarded that could make us any diſcovery of them, but preſently their Teſtimony muſt be gone. 'Tis very fine, but the Court over-rules it.</p>

                  <p>Look you, the anſwer is this Mr. <hi>Langhorne.</hi> You would charge Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> with falſity in ſaying he came over in the Pacquet-Boat with <hi>Hilſly,</hi> and you call up him, and he ſays, he did not come, but he left him at <hi>St. Omers;</hi> Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> comes and ſays, 'tis true, he left me there, but I over-took him at <hi>Calis,</hi> by this very token, ſaid he, you were cheated of your mony by a perſon that you lent it to, who went away, and left you to pay the Reckoning. When I asked Mr. <hi>Hilſly</hi> how he could tell if it were true that he was not with him, he anſwered, he was told it by another; but when I come to know what that other perſon ſaid, it was no more than this, he ſaid in Mr. <hi>Oats</hi>'s hearing Mr. <hi>Hilſly</hi> was cozened of his mony, but did not ſay how, nor by whom, nor where.</p>

                  <p>How come you to take more notice of the one, than the other? That he was there in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> rather than that he was there in <hi>July.</hi>

                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Now he hath anſwered plainly; when I asked the Queſtion, Why he did not take ſo much notice of thoſe Months, as he did of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May?</hi> He anſwered me, Becauſe the Queſtion did not fall upon thoſe Months; and that, without all Queſtion, is a plain and an honeſt Anſwer.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Just. Dolben.</speaker>

                  <p>Look you M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Langhorne,</hi> If he be to be believed, and that he doth not ſpeak falſly, or more than he knows, it is impoſſible that <hi>Oats</hi>'s Teſtimony and his can ſtand together; for he directly affirms he ſaw M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Oats</hi> the laſt of <hi>April,</hi> the 1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>, 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>May.</hi> Now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Oats</hi> ſays he was here then; ſo that theſe two cannot ſtand together. The Queſtion then is, Whether he be to be believed? And whether he does not come wilfully, or prepared? the Jury have beard what a kind of teſtimony he gives, when the Queſtion was asked him, How he came to take notice of the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> more than of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July?</hi> And why he was more ſure Sir <hi>John Warner</hi> was there at the one time, than at the other? Why,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97113:19"/>ſaid he, becauſe the Queſtion falls upon thoſe former Months, and not upon thoſe of <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July.</hi> Now that does ſhake all that was ſaid before, and looks as if he came on purpoſe, and prepared for thoſe Months, and now this, I am afraid, will go through all your S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Omers</hi> men.</p>

                  <p>It was a Feſtival Day. And the Feaſt we kept was the Invention of the Holy Croſs. We had the Action the day before, and ſome that were in the Infirmary would have it Acted over again to them, and we did ſo. My Lord, within one or two days after, Mr. <hi>Hilſly</hi> went away, I diſcourſed with Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> about half an hour; he came out within a day or two after out of the Infirmary, and I ſaw him walking in the Gallery. And again, the 2d of <hi>May</hi> I ſaw him walking with one Mr. <hi>Burnaby,</hi> who arrived the day before, the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> and then I ſaw him the 3d, 4th, and 5th; in this <hi>Burnaby</hi>'s company; I ſaw him again the 26th of <hi>May,</hi> with a Band about his head in order to Confirmation, for they always have a Linnen Cloth bound about their head at ſuch a time.</p>

                  <p>The man that keeps that part of the Houſe; and coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Office after my Recovery out of a Fit of Sickneſs a week before <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> or thereabouts, I ſaw Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> by this Circumſtance, The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitors of the Houſe ſaid they were glad to ſee me, and Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> being in that Place at the Refectory that was aſſigned to him, I asked who he was, and they told me ſuch an one, but I had heard of his admiſſion a few days before. Likewiſe Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> was there when Mr. <hi>Hilſly</hi> came for <hi>England,</hi> which was about the 24th of <hi>April,</hi> by this Circumſtance, that he was preſent in the Refectory with ſome of the Scholars Mr. <hi>Richard Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naby</hi> came to the Colledge about a week after Mr. <hi>Hilſly</hi> went away, and Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> was actually there then, and we did very much wonder that he became acquainted with him ſo quickly after his arrival. I ſay Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> was actually there when Mr. <hi>Killingbeck</hi> and Mr. <hi>Conqueſt</hi> came for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> about the 3d of <hi>May,</hi> by this Circumſtance, that I had ſome diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> and ſome others of the Scholars, that Mr. <hi>Conqueſt</hi> would by no means get out of his Bed betimes that day he was to go away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to leave the Colledge. He was there the 26th of <hi>May</hi> by this Circumſtance, that the Biſhop dined there that day, and Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> was there Confirmed that day. Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> was there alſo in <hi>June</hi> my Lord.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I don't know what he comes for, whether he comes as a Witneſs for me or not, perhaps he may.</p>

                  <speaker>E. of Caſtlemain.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I come to wait upon your Lordſhip and the Court to give you an account, that ſome of the Witneſſes that were ſummoned here for the Priſoners are ſo beaten and abuſed without, that they dare not come to give their Evidence, for fear of being killed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>That is a thing that is not to be ſuffered, let us but ſee any perſon that dares but offer to meddle with them, and I'le aſſure you we will take care to ſee them puniſhed according as they do deſerve.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Just. North.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis a very unjuſtifiable thing, a thing that we will very ſeverely puniſh, if they be hindred of free ingreſs and regreſs.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Juſt. Atkins.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed 'tis a very horrid thing that they ſhould be ſo abuſed, they ought to have their liberty of coming and giving their Evidence here without any moleſtation.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>E. of Caſtlemain.</speaker>
                  <p>I can aſſure your Lordſhip, that one of them was ſo beaten and bruiſed, that we can't tell but it may coſt him his life.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Just.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, we muſt look to ſuch a thing as that; for it is by no means to be allowed of. If your Lordſhip will but tell us who they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97113:24"/>are, let us but know them, and we will take care for the puniſhment of them; for we will ſhew our ſelves juſt and fair, and give them all the fair play that can be.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, it is in relation to a matter that happened at <hi>Irer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Tryal, I know not whether it be proper, but the Queſtion I would ask, is, whether <hi>Ireland</hi> were here in <hi>August</hi> or no?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>He hath given you no occaſion to ask this Queſtion at this Tryal: And is there any reaſon that we ſhould examine him to ſuch a thing? Do you think it reaſonable, or according to Law, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſhould be examined in your Tryal concerning what he then ſaid of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> being here in <hi>August,</hi> or not being here, when 'tis no part of his accuſation that he brings againſt you?

                  <speaker>L. C. J. North.</speaker>
                  <p>Since he gave not any occaſion or uſe for ſuch a proof now at this time, 'tis not fit he ſhould be examined about it: Indeed ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday he gave it in Evidence, becauſe it concerned a circumſtance of time that related to the Priſoners then to be tryed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis true as my Lord ſayes, That it was yeſterday pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, becauſe he gave Evidence that <hi>Fenwick</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> were here in <hi>Anguſt</hi> together. Now that did ſome way concern him, but you have no concern at all in it.</p>

                  <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> hath affirmed, when I asked him touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his receiving a Reward, he ſaid, he had his Reward, for he had been out of purſe ſix or ſeven hundred pound, and it is my deſire to examine a couple of Witneſſes touching the probability of that; for he was ſo very poor before this happened, that it is impoſſible without a Purſe being made for him to lay out ſix or ſeven hundred pound.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Look you, here is the thing, he gives you an Anſwer to which he was not in the leaſt bound, nor is it to be charged by you; he ſayes he is out 700<hi rend="sup">l</hi>, but that is not any Evidence, nor is the Jury to take notice of it, nor is it to affect him.

                  <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I'le tell you how far it concerns me, the proving of his Indigency before this thing happened, will concern me thus far,—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>If you ſhould prove this man in an indigent condition, what is that to the preſent purpoſe, it goes to no part of the Evidence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I ask the Queſtion for this Reaſon, for certainly if he were ſo very indigent, it cannot be imagined in probability that any man would truſt him with ſuch a great ſumm, unleſs it were to give this Evidence.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Cr. Levins.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard the Evidence that Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> hath given for the making of his defence, which hath been principally to reflect upon Mr. <hi>Oates;</hi> and he firſt calls M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Hilſly</hi> to prove, that whereas Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> did ſwear he came over with him, he affirms he did not; but it falls out, that Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> hath counterproved him by ſuch a circumſtance as does contradict him in what he ſays; for ſpeaking of the loſs of his money, <hi>Hilſly</hi> ſaid, ſome body elſe had told him
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97113:26"/>of it; but producing his Witneſs for that, he only affirms, that Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> in his company was told, that Mr. <hi>Hilſly</hi> had loſt his money, but not how nor where; but Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> gives you a particular circumſtance, that he was cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a perſon he lent his money to, and that left him to pay the Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which Mr. <hi>Hilſley</hi> does confeſs was true, and which he could not hear from the others, for the others did never know it. Gentlemen, they have brought you a great many other Witneſſes to prove, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was not in <hi>England</hi> on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> the time he ſays he was, and they all agree as to that time, tho' as to other times they are not ſo exact; but we ſhall give you as plain and as full an Evidence that he was here at that time, as that you are there now, and ſhall very fully ſatisfie you in it. For that of Sir <hi>John Warner,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Preſton</hi> they are matters that were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted beyond Sea, to be ſure they did not come over by thoſe Names, no more did Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> himſelf; therefore it would be hard to find out theſe Perſons, or to give you ſo particular an account of them that were thus in Diſguiſes, and had changed their Names; but truly if that were a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter done in <hi>England,</hi> it were far more eaſie for us to confront their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in that; for matters that are done here lye more ready for our proof, than thoſe that are done beyond Sea; for the laſt woman that he called, which was the woman about the <hi>White Horſe</hi> Tavern, her Evidence would have gone as punctually for truth, if it had been a matter done in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as any thing could be in the world; but it happening to be near home, it hath the ill fortune to meet with a very ſudden Anſwer, which is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt proof how they ſtretch to help themſelves, and in my opinion this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction overthrows all their Evidence. Gentlemen, we will call out Witneſſes, and prove it as plainly as any thing can be in the world, that Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> was here at that time. Firſt ſwear <hi>Will. Walker (which was done.)</hi>

                  <p>I ſaw him the latter end of <hi>March</hi> 1678. or towards the middle of <hi>April</hi> following, I ſaw him then in a diſguiſe, inſomuch as that I knowing what he was, and what he had been, I could not a great while recollect the face of the man, and it was a great trouble to me, that having known him ſo many years, I ſhould not then know him. I went home, but could not recollect my ſelf that night; but before I roſe again the next morning, I did recollect my ſelf that it was <hi>Titus Oats,</hi> and I preſently tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my ſelf out of my bed, and went to a Gentlewoman whoſe name I did not then well know, to inquire of her about it. After the Salutation, ſaid I, How does Mr. <hi>Oats?</hi> ſaid ſhe, knocking her hand upon the Counter, He is an undone man: Why, what is the matter, ſaid I? He is turned, ſaid ſhe, to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Do you know where he is, ſaid I? No, ſaid ſhe, but he is lurking up and down the Town, and only dares appear in the evenings. Well then, ſaid I, I ſaw him later than you did; for I ſaw him between St. <hi>Martins</hi>-lane and <hi>Leiceſter</hi> houſe yeſterday, but he was in a diſguiſe: and I told her what habit he was in.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr Walker.</speaker>

                  <p>He hath ſaid the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> or the middle of <hi>April,</hi> I would have him be as certain as he can.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>He cannot be certain; for thoſe things in point of time, you know and all mankind muſt agree, that a thing done a year ago that was of no greater importance at that time, cannot ſo eaſily be remembred, or that he ſhould take ſuch ſpecial notice of the critical day. What man in the world does remember or take notice ſo as to charge himſelf in what week or what month ſuch an accidental thing as this happened? But to ſatisfie Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> I ask you, Can you ſpeak any more particularly than you have done?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Walker.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe I would not be miſtaken or do any one any wrong, I do rather take an uncertain time than a certain, but I do think it was in the month of <hi>April</hi> and towards the middle of the month, that is all I can ſay.</p>

                  <p>But how is he ſure, ſince he is ſo uncertain in his memory, that this was 1678, and not 1677?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Walker.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe, my Lord, it was but a little more than a year ſince, and I am able to judge of the year as well as another.</p>

                  <p>I was wont about that time of year to receive money of my Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> and upon that Errand I came to Town then.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Walker.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, my Lord; for according to my apprehenſion I did know the face when I firſt ſaw it, but I could not recollect who it was till I had refreſhed my memory, and the next morning I did ſo, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it was he.</p>

                  <speaker>Butler.</speaker>
                  <p>I was in the Gate about my Coach, and he comes in and asked me if Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> was within: I told him no; at preſent I did not know him, becauſe he was in ſuch a diſguiſed habit; I knew him very well before, becauſe he went in ſuch an habit as he does now; but this is the man, and <hi>Titus Oates</hi> in his name. Said I, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> you are welcome into <hi>England</hi> again, but he took no notice but went forward into the houſe, but he made but a little ſtay there, and came out again; it ſeems ſomebody had affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and laughed at him, becauſe he was more like a Shepherd than a Miniſter: His hair was cut, and he had a gray Coat on, and plain Shooes, and a flopping Hat, and ſo he went out of the Gate, and would not take any notice of me, or what I ſaid.</p>

                  <p>I know it by this Circumſtance: In <hi>February</hi> I went down into <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and I came up again the ſame month: Sir <hi>Rich.

                  <p>I never ſaw his fact before that time, nor had I taken notice of him then, but that there was a young man that lived with Sir <hi>Rich. Barker</hi> who had a great acquaintance with him, and ſeeing him in that Garb, he called me to the window, and ſaid, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſurely is turn'd Quaker or Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite by the change of his habit; no ſaid I, he is no Quaker, for he hath got a Perriwig on.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I am charged here by two Witneſſes, the firſt is Mr. <hi>Oates;</hi> If I can prove any one point (in anſwer to that which he hath given in Evidence) not to be true, then I conceive, my Lord, he ought to be ſet aſide: And I think it hath been clearly proved, That whereas he ſaid Sir <hi>Tho. Preſton</hi> came over with him in <hi>April,</hi> it hath been clearly proved he was then at <hi>Leige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> and whereas he hath affirmed, Sir <hi>John Warner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> and two or three more that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97113:30"/>were at St. <hi>Omers</hi> came over with him, I have proved That not to be true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any contradiction: Then, as the Witneſſes about his ovvn not coming over in <hi>April,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hilſly</hi> ſays he came not over vvith him in the Pacquet-Boat; and the other ſays that he vvas ſick in the Infirmary after Mr. <hi>Hilſly</hi> came avvay: Theſe points being thus proved, I think there can be no credit given to what he ſays; for I can ſay, and I know it to be truth, that from <hi>November</hi> 1677, to this very day I never ſavv him: I have been a cloſe Priſoner ſo long, and have had but one weeks time to provide, and therefore muſt be fain to take ſuch Information as my Friends and Relations could pick up, to anſwer what he hath ſaid in his Narratives, ſuppoſing he would have ſaid the ſame here; therefore I am not able to make any better defence.</p>

                  <p>He brought me a Letter from one of my Sons, my younger Son in <hi>Spain,</hi> and then he told me he was going to St. <hi>Omers:</hi> He ſaid he could not and from that day I never ſaw him till I ſaw him in the Court: I hope truly I have well proved that he was not here in <hi>England</hi> when he ſays he was, but that I muſt leave to the Jury: But ſurely theſe Boys cannot be ſuppoſed to have any deſign, or to be bribed by any Reward, for I never ſaw the Face of any of them till now.</p>

                  <p>If that be an Objection againſt them, I think it is hard if they are not to be believed becauſe they are <hi>Papiſts</hi> and Friends; then the other on the contrary are not to be believed becauſe they are Enemies. I think it is clear that he did not lodge at <hi>Grove</hi>'s houſe, and I think it is clear that he did not come over in the Pacquet-Boat with Mr. <hi>Hilſly,</hi> and that Sir <hi>Tho. Preſton</hi> did not come over with him, nor <hi>Warner,</hi> nor <hi>Poole;</hi> and if any of theſe points be clear for me, I think his Teſtimony ought to be ſet aſide. Now as to what <hi>Bedloe</hi> ſays, in truth it is impoſſible for me to examine any Witneſſes, and that I think will be your Lordſhip's Opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will not ſeem probable that one that was in my way of practice ſhould become a Clerk to Regiſter Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to keep Accounts of any particular Religious Order, as he makes me to do; or, if I were, that I ſhould admit Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> to be privy to thoſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; but that I muſt leave to the Court, my Lord, 'tis impoſſible to prove a Negative: Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> is a perſon that I have no acquaintance with, truly I do not know that ever I ſaw him before this time in all my life; though it is poſſible I may have ſeen him, but I do not knovv that ever I did: Now that I ſhould admit ſuch a perſon to ſuch a privacy in Accounts of this nature, (if I were guilty of them) ſeems very improbable; but yet, as I ſaid, it is impoſſible to prove a Negative. If I had known what he would have charged upon me before, perhaps I might have made a better defence; and for thoſe Witneſſes that I have had, they were prepared by ſuch Friends as thought they would be uſeful for me. Theſe men have had time to get their Witneſſes together. <hi>I</hi> never ſaw one of mine till they came into the Court: I hope, my Lord, I ſhall find no diſadvantage in my condemned me meerly for that: I diſclaim all Principles of diſloyalty, and I do aſſure your Lordſhip, I do believe it is Damnation to any one that ſhall go about to kill the King or deprive him of his Government; I ſhall leave the reſt to your Lordſhip and the Jury.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Look you, Gentlemen; You have had an Accompt in the firſt Part of the Evidence in general, That there was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deſigne of bringing in <hi>Propery;</hi> and in order to that, as the beſt and quickeſt Means to Accompliſh it, to deſtroy the <hi>King.</hi> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, they were in the right for that Matter: To deſtroy the <hi>King,</hi> was the moſt effectual Courſe to introduce <hi>Popery</hi> they could take. Whether they would do it or no, is not now any Queſtion; but how much Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> the Priſoner at the Barr, is concerned in it; and that depends upon the Teſtimony of Witneſſes.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>The Teſtimony that Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> gives againſt him, amounts but to thus much: <hi>I cannot affirm</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that Mr.</hi> Langhorne, <hi>was at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult on the Twenty-Fourth of</hi> April, <hi>at the</hi> White-Horſe-Tavern, <hi>where they ſigned the Agreement to Deſtroy the</hi> King: <hi>But this I can ſay, That the next Day, or within a Day or two, I went by Order from the Fathers,</hi> Whitebread <hi>and</hi> Harcourt, <hi>to</hi> Langhorne<hi>'s Chamber, and acquainted him with what they had Argeed upon.</hi> And he ſwears, that Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> did lift up his Hands and Eyes, and pray to God to give them good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. He tells you further, That after ſome Talk with him about bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of <hi>Popery,</hi> and deſtroying of the <hi>King,</hi> he had alſo Diſcourſe concerning ſeveral Commiſſions; that he ſaw about Seven or Eight of them, and that he told him, he had more: One for my Lord <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſis</hi> to be General, and one for himſelf to be Advocate-General, with others; but thoſe (he ſayes) he ſaw, and peruſed them: And though he does not know of the delivery of thoſe ſeveral Commiſſions, yet he does know of the delivery of one to his Son, to be carryed to my Lord of <hi>Arundel</hi>'s eldeſt Son; And he does ſay, That <hi>Mr. Langhorn</hi> did tell him, he had ſent it; and Swears, that he had ſome diſcourſe with him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Killing the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bedlow,</hi> he comes and Swears, That he was there Twice, and that he ſaw him Tranſcribe Letters; and that the Effect of one of them was, That they were prepared with Armes, and all things but Money. That the Garriſons alſo were ready to be Delivered up to them, but they ſtaid only for this, and Six Thouſand Pounds would do it, which the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines were to raiſe. If that came, then there was nothing wanting. They had an eaſy King, whom they could deſtroy as they pleaſed; An Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in Readineſs, Every thing in Good Poſture, and no time like this, to bring in Popery: Which Diſcourſe, he ſayes, was before Mr. <hi>Coleman.</hi> Here is the Effect then of thoſe Letters which by him were written into a Book, and in which this Plot and this Contrivance was mentioned. Theſe were Tranſcribed by <hi>Mr. Langhorn</hi> (ſayes he) while <hi>Mr. Coleman</hi> and I walked in his Chamber. I ſaw him write them, and he Swears it.</p>
               <p>Now the Matter is this; If theſe Two Witneſſes do Swear True, then is this Indictment of <hi>Treaſon</hi> highly Proved. For the Contriving <hi>To bring in Popery, To Levy War,</hi> and <hi>To Kill the KING</hi> (which, when he was Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withall, he lift up his Hands and Eyes, and begg'd of God to give it good Succeſs; and which <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſayes was the Effect of the Letters that he Tranſcribed into the Book) <hi>Mr. Langhorn</hi> himſelf will not deny to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97113:31"/>be High Treaſon: and when this is Sworn here by <hi>Two Witneſſes,</hi> he muſt either Invalidate their <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> or Acknowledge it <hi>Juſt,</hi> if you find him Guilty or the Indictment with which he is Charged. Now the Queſtion is, What Defence there is againſt it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Langhorn</hi> ſayes, If I can Diſprove a Witneſs in any one material thing that he ſayes, then will it take off from his Credit in every thing he ſayes. And firſt as to <hi>Mr. Oats,</hi> ſaith he, I did know him, I muſt Confeſs, but I never ſaw him ſince the year 1677. The Thing that <hi>Mr. Oats</hi> Charges him with, is in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May</hi> 1678, or thereabouts; And <hi>Mr. Langhorn</hi> ſayes, he never ſaw him ſince 77. Why? <hi>Mr. Oats,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Was not here in England,</hi> and produces a great many Witneſſes that came from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, to Teſtifie that <hi>Mr. Oats</hi> was there in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And whereas <hi>Mr. Oats</hi> ſayes, that there came over in his Company with him, Sir <hi>John Warner,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. Preſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> and others. He proves by ſome Witneſſes, that <hi>Mr. Oats</hi> was there both Months; and by others, that Sir <hi>John Warner</hi> was at <hi>Watton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Preſton</hi> at <hi>Leige,</hi> and <hi>Pool</hi> at St. <hi>Omers</hi> at the time that <hi>Mr. Oats</hi> ſayes they came over with him: And this ſayes he, I hope will be plain Evidence why you ſhould not believe <hi>Mr. Oats;</hi> and the rather, becauſe theſe Witneſſes are ſuch (ſayes he as that I do not ſo much as know their Faces; and you will not preſume, that People to whom I am wholly a Stranger, ſhould come hither from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> to teſtify a Lye for me.</p>
               <p>In Anſwer to this, I ſay, 'Tis no good Argument for all that; for though I believe they are Strangers to him, they are not Strangers to the Errand they come about. They come to Defend all the <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> whom we would hang here for a <hi>Plot;</hi> and they are ſent over for that purpoſe, as far as their Teſtimony can go. How far that is, Though they are not upon their Oaths, (for the Law will not permit it) I muſt ſay to you, in favour of the Priſoner at the Bar, as I did to the <hi>Jury</hi> Yeſterday, You muſt not take it therefore, as if it were mere Talk and no more; nor reject them too much, becauſe they do not Swear: They would Swear ('tis likely) if the Law would allow it. Only one remark I muſt obſerve to you upon their own Evidence: The St. <hi>Omers</hi> Gardiner (which is one of them) takes upon him to give a very exact Account of Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> in the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May;</hi> but when I came to enquire what he knew of him in the Months of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> he tells you, <hi>Thoſe were not the Months in queſtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, Did not the Principles of their Religion ſo Teach, and make us to know, that they will not ſtick at any Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to propagate it: Did not the beſt and chiefeſt Doctors of their Church, Preach and Print it: Did not his Holineſs, the <hi>Pope,</hi> allow it; and never condemn any one Book in the World, that hath Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Lawfulneſs of DEPOSING and KILLING KINGS, for ſeparating from their Religion: Did not they Teach and Practice all ſorts of Equivocations, and that a Lye does God good Service, if it be for the Propagation of the Faith: Were not theſe Young Boys capable of having this Doctrine inſtill'd into them; and VVere not they bred up in Colledges chiefly to ſerve that End, then Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> had ſaid ſomething. Neither are theſe things Artificially obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt them, for the Doctrines of their Church are ſo Falſe and Penurious, ſo Deſtructive and ſo Bloody; and the way they take to come off from all Vows, Oaths, and Sacraments, by Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97113:31"/>before-hand, or Indulgence and Pardons afterwards, is a thing ſtill ſo much worſe, that they are really unfit for Human Society. They ſhould get their <hi>Pope,</hi> if they would not have it thrown into their Diſh, and have it believed by us; I ſay, they ſhould get the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to decry and Anathematize ſuch Doctrines of Depoſing and Killing Kings, and Diſcharging Subjects from their Allegiance: But that will never be; for his Holineſs, the <hi>Pope,</hi> will keep himſelf where he is, and will part with Nothing that he hath of Advantage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any.</p>
               <p>Look you, Gentlemen, thus much I cannot omit with a good Conſcience to ſay, The Profeſſion, the Doctrines, and the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſuch, that it does take away a great part of the Faith that ſhould be given to theſe Witneſſes; nevertheleſs we muſt be fair, and ſhould hear them, if we could not Anſwer what they alleadge, by Evidence to the contrary. Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> therefore to juſtify himſelf, hath produced I think, Seven or Eight Witneſſes, that do prove, that he was here in the latter end of <hi>April</hi> and beginning of <hi>May,</hi> which does contradict all their Teſtimony, who does ſay he was abroad all along from <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> to <hi>June,</hi> and that they ſaw him every other Day.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, if we were certain that what theſe Young-men ſpake, were indeed ſo as they ſay, it is impoſſible for Mr. <hi>Oats</hi>'s Teſtimony to be believed. If I were ſatisfyed that really and truly Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> was not here, but was Six Months together there, and that he hath invented this Story and made this himſelf; I could no longer confide in the Man, nor find Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> Guilty: Yet is not the Time really the ſubſtance of the thing, though he hath made it ſo now, becauſe the <hi>Conſult</hi> was the <hi>Twenty Fourth</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> which he was preſent; and he did go (he ſaies) to Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> within a Day or two after, to acquaint him with the reſolution of it.</p>
               <p>To this end hath Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> produced Seven or Eight Witneſſes that ſaw him, as they ſwear. He hath produced a Miniſter, that ſays he ſaw him in a Diſguiſe, but having known him before, recollected him to be the Man. He hath produced a VVoman that agrees with that Story; for ſhe ſays, that he came and talk'd with her about it, and told her then that he had ſeen Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> the Day before, and gives you a token why it was about that time of the Year. Now if this be not a new matter, and New found out, this VVoman (if ſhe ſwears true) does juſtify the other in what he did ſay a Year ago, when they could never Imagine that any great weight and moment ſhould be laid upon that Accident of his ſeeing <hi>Oats</hi> in the Street. He hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to you the Coach-man of Sir <hi>Richard Barker,</hi> that ſays he knew him well, when he came to his Maſters Houſe. There he call'd him by his name, That asking for Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> but not finding him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he went away preſently. That he was in Diſguiſe, That they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted their Maſter with it aſ ſoon as he came Home, and their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſays that ſo they did. And the perſon that then lived in the Houſe, and now is Dead, ſaid to the Maid: Yonder is Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> I think he is either Turned <hi>Quaker</hi> or <hi>Prieſt,</hi> what a kind of Habit is he got into? No ſaid the Maid, he can't be a <hi>Quaker</hi> becauſe he wears a <hi>Perriwigg;</hi> but ſhe ſays, he named him to her, <hi>Oats,</hi> and that this is the man, ſhe knew him ſince. 'Tis the ſame man that the Young-man ſpoke to her about.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:97113:32"/>
               <p>He hath produced farther one of their own Religion, one that is a Papiſt ſtill; and he ſays, he ſaw him twice at Mr. <hi>Charles Howard</hi>'s, in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel</hi> Houſe. There was indeed ſome perplexity, they would have put upon it, by reaſon of Mr. <hi>Howards</hi> Son being dead a year before; but the VVitneſs ſaies he did not know the Son. A Papiſt he confeſſes himſelf expreſly to be, if not a Prieſt; and I would not ask him the Queſtion, becauſe 'tis not fair to make him accuſe himſelf: but he does ſwear expreſly, he ſaw Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> at Mr. <hi>Charles Howards</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> which contradicts all their VVitneſſes. He alſo produces a Schoolmaſter, that tells that he dined with him the beginning of <hi>May:</hi> and I remember it (ſays he) very well, for we dined by the fire-ſide, which gave me occaſion to wonder at it in <hi>May</hi> and remember it. He ſays moreover, that he ſtayd Three or Four hours with him, and tall'd of all his Travels in <hi>Spain.</hi> Now muſt all theſe people be down-right Perjured; it can be no miſtake, but they are all falſly forſworn, if there be not Truth in it. And when here are Seven or Eight Witneſſes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively ſwearing againſt the affirmation of ſo many others, we leave the credit of both ſides to you, who are the Judges of the Fact.</p>
               <p>There is indeed (and I will Repeat it for you, for, I would not miſs any thing as near as I can that would make for the Priſoners advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage); there is a proof concerning Sir <hi>John Warner,</hi> and <hi>Preſton,</hi> and <hi>Pool,</hi> that they were there at the time, and there hath been no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer given to it: But I ſay ſtill, tis the ſame thing, for if you do not believe thoſe VVitneſſes to ſpeak true, that affirm that <hi>Oates</hi> was there all the time, but rather believe that he was here, by Seven or Eight people that Teſtify it: I ſay if you cannot believe he was there, you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver change your mind for one Circumſtance, whether he came over with Sir <hi>John Warner</hi> and others, or not; for it is but a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

                  <p>No they do not, for I leave it to you of the Jury up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter; there is little more to be ſaid by me. If ſo be Credit is to be given to theſe VVitneſſes of <hi>Oats</hi> more than to the others, then you muſt find him Guilty, and the rather, becauſe I do a little ſuſpect they come over inſtructed to ſay what they do. You find they apply themſelves to the thing they came for, and not only the Gardiner, but another could tell you (which hath a very great Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon me as to their Credit) that the months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> were the months in <hi>queſtion,</hi> and they were not to be examined any farther. So that it looks, as if theſe Young men were ſent of an Errand, and though you do not know them Mr. <hi>Langorn,</hi> and are Innocent as to any tampering with them, yet I am afraid they are come to ſerve the Catholick Cauſe as they call it. For, they are very well taught, and they keep to thoſe months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> of all the months in the Year. Then they bring the VVoman of the <hi>White-Horſe</hi>-Tavern, where the Conſult of the twenty fourth of <hi>April</hi> was; and what is the uſe they would make of her? why it is, that Mr. <hi>Oats</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:97113:32"/>ſhould make a ſtory of fifty Fathers being in her Tavern at one time (but he inſiſts now, there was a matter of twenty) when there was not a Room in her Houſe that would hold Ten: But you hear how ſhe was Anſwered, from Teſtimony riſing up in the Court of themſelves that were accquainted with her Houſe, and know, that Forty people may dine in two of her Rooms: And the Kings Counſel obſerved well, how Chance it ſelf hath put to ſilence this Evidence. So that when mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are alledged to be done at <hi>home,</hi> there is not ſo great a difficulty as in proving things that are done <hi>abroad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I leave it to you Sirs. Here is a Gentleman that ſtands at the Bar upon his Life on the one Hand; but if Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſay true, all our Lives, and Liberties, our King and Religion, are at the Stake on the other Hand. God defend that Innocent Blood ſhould be ſhed, and God defend us alſo from Popery, and from all popiſh Plots, and from all the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Principles of Papiſts, which are very Cruel as we know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; and you cannot blame us to look to our ſelves. For I muſt tell you, the Plot is proved as plain as the Day, and that by <hi>Oats;</hi> and farther, <hi>Oats</hi> Teſtimony is confirm'd by that which can never be Anſwered. For when he comes at his firſt Teſtimony and ſays that upon the twenty fourth of <hi>April</hi> ſuch a Conſult was ſummoned &amp; held, it falls out that five days after a Letter is found amongſt <hi>Harcourts</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, (a principal Perſon in the Deſign), which does order the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> being the day after St. <hi>Georges</hi> Feaſt, and gives them a Caution that they ſhould not come too ſoon to Town; That they ſhould not appear too much in <hi>London</hi> for fear of diſcovering the <hi>Deſign,</hi> and of diſcloſing <hi>that, the nature of which requires Secrecy.</hi> Plainer than this is hardly to be writ from a Jeſuit. Eſpecially in ſo dangerous a matter. And what can be anſwered to this Letter that is found in a Prieſts Hand four days after Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had given in his Information about it?</p>
                  <p>Put all this together, and if you be ſatisfi'd herein, you may judg the better, as to the particular buſineſs of Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> how far the Teſtimony of <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow</hi> affect him. You know what you do. And for <hi>Bedlow</hi> 'tis true what he ſays, that there is nothing to be ſaid to his Evidence, becauſe no man can prove a Negative; and he ſwears expreſly that he had this Diſcourſe with him of theſe Treaſonable matters, Killing the King, and Altering Religion. If this be ſo, and you are ſatisfi'd in that particular (and that a man may very well be as to the ſubſtance), I do not ſee any conſiderable Anſwer that is given. I ſay once more, there is the life of a Gentleman at ſtake, and there are all our Lives at the Stake: Follow you your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; Do Wiſely, do Honeſtly, and conſider what is to be done.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> might very well be able to ſpeak of this mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, of this Congregation as they call it, before this Letter was taken, 'tis eaſy to believe, becauſe Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> being at Saint <hi>Omers,</hi> I ſuppoſe the like Letters of Summons might come over to Saint <hi>Omers,</hi> to fetch ſome of them over hither.</p>

                  <p>You ſay well, but if you have but the Luck to give me an Anſwer, to a thing or two, you'l have better fortune, and more skill than the <hi>Prieſts.</hi> 'Tis true, he might perchance know of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, if he were at Saint <hi>Omers:</hi> But will you tell us what that <hi>Deſign</hi> was? And what is the meaning of the putting thoſe words into the Letter, <hi>That they ſhould not come too ſoon to</hi> London, <hi>nor appear too much about Town, for fear of diſcovering that Deſign,</hi> which they knew required Secrecy in its own Nature?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I will tell you, what I take to be the meaning of that Letter. The Deſign was the holding of a Congregation: There were diverſe of them, and it was like the meeting of a Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a Colledge, and he bids them not to come too long before the time, for they were certainly in very great danger to be taken.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>What! At that time? What Danger were they in then?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, my Lord, the Parliament was then ſitting.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>But you know what Indulgence there was to all <hi>Papists</hi> at that time, if they would be but quiet. VVell, but put it altogether, they were to come to <hi>London, not too ſoon, nor to appear too much,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Parliament was ſitting, <hi>for fear of Diſcovering the Deſign.</hi> What, was that only for Mr. <hi>Whitebread,</hi> and his fellows, to make an Officer! Can it be anſwered by that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly their holding of a Congregation in <hi>England,</hi> does require ſecrecy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Gentlemen! Here is the thing, This is only an Evidence to the Plot in general, that there is a Plot, and you may make what reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable uſe you think fit of it. It is not a Particular Evidence againſt Mr. <hi>Langhorns</hi> particular Perſon, Only it ſhews there was a Plot, and you have heard what they ſay to him in particular about it. And I'le tell you one thing more, which if <hi>Oats</hi> ſwears true, concerns you very much. He ſaith they were a talking of the Ten Thouſand Pounds that Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was to have for Poyſoning the King when their other attempts had failed, and that he would not take under Fifteen Thouſand Pound. You Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> was very angry, and ſaid it was a baſe covetous thing in him; and it being ſuch a publick Cauſe,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97113:33"/>it would have been no matter if he had done it for Nothing. I have repeated as much as I can well remember without any prejudice to Mr. <hi>Langhorns</hi> Teſtimony. And ſo I leave it with you.</p>
                  <stage>
                     <hi>Then an Officer was Sworn to keep the Jury, who withdrew to conſider of their Verdict; and. the Judges alſo went off from the Bench.

                  <p>You, the Priſoners at the Bar: You have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally Arraigned, and now are ſeverally Convicted of High Treaſon. And that attended with all the ill Circumſtances, that can be poſſible to aggravate ſo High a Crime. You attempted the Life of the beſt of Kings; who was full of Mercy and Compaſſion even to You, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom you might ſtill have lived peaceably and quietly, had not your own Malice and Miſchiefs prevented it. Nor were you ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that alone; for you intended thereby to make way for the Deſtruction of the greateſt Part of the Kingdom, by a Publick Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre, by Cutting, the Throats of all <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> for that alſo appears to be your Deſigne: To effect which the neareſt way, and the beſt Means you could think of, was firſt to Kill the King. And this was to be done, for the introducing of another Religion, as you call it; which, as we think, we more properly call Superſtition; and ſo root out the beſt Religion that is Eſtabliſhed amongſt us by Law. And I therefore call it the Beſt of Religions, even for your ſakes; for had it not been for the ſake of our Religion, that teaches us not to make ſuch Requitals, as yours ſeems to teach you, you had not had that fair formal way of Tryal, and of being Heard, as you now have been; but Murder would have been returned to you, for the Murder you intended to commit both upon the King, and moſt of his People. What a ſtrange ſort of Religion is that, whoſe Doctrine ſeems to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to be the greateſt Saints in another VVorld, that can be the moſt Impudent Sinners in This? Murder, and the Blackeſt of Crimes here, are the beſt Means among you, to get a Man to be Canonized a Saint hereafter. Is it not ſtrange, that Men Profeſſed in Religion, that uſe all Endeavours to gain Proſelytes for Heaven, ſhould ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Scripture, (as I perceive, ſome of you have done) and make that Juſtify your Impious Deſignes of Aſſaſſinating Kings, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their Subjects? VVhat can be ſaid to ſuch a Sort of People, the very Foundation of whoſe Religion is laid in Blood? Nay, leſt you ſhould not be able ſo eaſily to perſwade them ſo cleverly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe thoſe Bloody Principles, you do Abſolve them from all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations that they remain under, of Obedience to their Soveraign; You do therefore from the Pulpits publickly teach, That the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, ſignify nothing. It's a ſtrange Religion,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97113:34"/>that applyes every thing to theſe wicked and deteſtable Purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>There is one Gentleman that ſtands at the Bar, whom I am very ſorry to ſee with all my Heart in this Condition, becauſe of ſome Acquaintance I have had with him heretofore: To ſee a Man who hath Underſtanding in the Law, and who hath arrived to ſo great an Eminency in that Profeſſion, as that Gentleman hath done, ſhould not remember, that 'tis not only againſt the Rules of all Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but even againſt the Rules of his Profeſſion, to Attempt any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury againſt the Perſon of the King. He knows, that it is againſt all the Rules of Law, to endeavour to introduce any Forreign Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Land. So that, you ſinned both againſt your Conſcience; and your own certain Knowledge. But your ſeveral Crimes have been ſo fully Proved againſt you, that truly, I think no Perſon that ſtands by, can be in any doubt of the Guilt: Nor is there the leaſt room for the moſt Scrupulous Man to doubt of the Credibility of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that have been Examined againſt You: And ſure I am, You have been fully Heard, and ſtand fairly Convicted of thoſe Crimes you have been Indicted for.</p>
                  <p>I rather mention theſe things to you, becauſe I know not whether you will think it neceſſary to have any Aſſiſtance, (I mean, ſuch Aſſiſtance as by the Law of the Land, is to be allowed to Perſons in your Condition, of any Proteſtant Divines, or of any other Proteſtants) to prepare you for another World. And though what hath been ſaid proceeds from a Lay-man, to you that are Profeſſed in Religion; yet I hope, it will not be thought amiſs, it being intended for your Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Let that vaſt Eternity, that you are ere long to enter into, you are now on the Brink of it; I ſay, let that prevail with you to conſider, that there is a God in Heaven, who will call you to an Account for every one of thoſe Private Conſultations, of which we can never come to any certain Knowledge. Though you have put all thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Secreſy, upon your Party, which Religion could tye them by: Though you give them the Sacrament, not only to oblige <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>em to do wicked Acts, but to conceal them when they are done; Yet remember, there is a God in Heaven, from whom you cannot keep them Secret. All your Tyes and Obligations, all the Diſpenſations that you can give to your Inferiors, or your Superiors to you, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſpenſe with that Accompt you are to give to the great God of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, with great Charity to your immortal Souls, I deſire you for the Love of God, and in the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, Conſider theſe things; For, it will not be long e're you be Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd before another Tribunal about them: And great and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is the Day of Judgment, at which you and all Men muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p>And I hope all perſons that ſtand by, will take notice, that it is not the Principles of the Proteſtant Religion to Murder any (let it be upon their own Heads that profeſs it) for we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor theſe things. And we hope theſe publick Teſtimonies of our Religion, and this fair ſort of Tryal, will not only Confirm thoſe that are Proteſtants now, but will prevail upon thoſe whom they have Inveigled into their Perſwaſion, to deſert ſuch a Religion, till ſuch time as they alter their Principles, from the bloodineſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity they are ſtained with, and which theſe Men have inſtilled into all their Proſelites. And this I thought fit to premiſe to you in great
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97113:35"/>Compaſſion and Charity. And I pray God it may have that effect, which I deſigned; time is, that it may put you in mind of that great immortallity that you are to enter upon ere long. And thus having given you this hint, and the Law having had its Courſe upon you, you have been fairly tryed, fully heard, and have thing to ſay why that Judgment ſhould not be pronounced, which the Law hath deſigned againſt ſuch Offenders: I am therefore in the Name of the Court to do the Duty which the Law requires of the Court; and I do in the Name of the Court pronounce this to be your Sentence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That you be Conveyed from Hence to the Place from whence you came; and from thence you be drawn to the place of Execution upon Hurdles, that you be there ſeverally hang'd by the Neck, that you be Cut down alive, that your Privy Members be cut off, that you Bowels be taken out and burnt in your view, that your Heads be ſever'd from you Bodies, that you Bodies be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into four Quarters, and your Quarters to be at the King</hi>'s <hi>Diſpoſe.</hi>
